I'm Jonatas Lima, doing my 20s with a big smile, trying to be a developer focused in cybersec, and trying to be a good person in the path of my life (that part is showing to be hard, but i'll never give up because that's not my ninja style (sry for the naruto thing haha)).

This blog is supposed to be like my open life book. So i'll end up bringing some content and stuff related in hacking, career as a dev, retro-gaming, a lots and lots of geek and nerd things. So i hope you enjoy my life! ãƒ„

This blog is starting from a fork of the father god's Akita repo in [GitHub](https://github.com/akitaonrails/akitaonrails.github.io), and go see his [website](https://akitaonrails.com/) too.

I've been writing online since 2025. I know that i don't have a lot of posts yet, but with time it'll be populated...

As my dad Akita said one time "I am always dabbling and ruminating about random tech topics on [X](https://x.com/satanoj_fk/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ojon.sama/). Both are protected and personal accounts, so you have to request permission to join. And beware that I frequently block and report spammers and haters alike. Joining is a privilege, do not waste it."

If you have important matters to talk to me, you can send an email to me directly [contact email](mailto:jonatasslimaa00@gmail.com). I won't reply unless it interests me.

Dad Akita disclaimer: I like your job and your life style a lot, so don't be mad with me S2. It's just an inspiration...
